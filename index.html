            <h3>Patented Technology</h3>
            <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit <span>strong neural phase locking-</span>
                allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity-and technology to remove distraction in sound.<br/>
                
                This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words, we've found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.

            <h3>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h3>
            <p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments.</p>
            <p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performence on simple games.</p>
            <p><span>Our experiments always include a control condition('placebo')</span>of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.</p>
